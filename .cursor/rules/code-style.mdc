# Code Style Guidelines

- Prefer to keep things as simple as you can
- When generating code, do it in small units and check in often to see how your progress is going
- Multiple small units of code changes are preferred over large changes
- Don't write code comments that don't explain something important, like an important decision
- If you have ideas of how to make things better but they escape the current ask, propose them instead of implementing them outright
- Update or create new rules whenever you notice a pattern in how code should be generated
