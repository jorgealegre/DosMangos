### Focus State Management

```swift
// In State
struct State: Equatable {
    enum Field {
        case value, description
    }
    var focus: Field?
}

// In View
@FocusState var focus: TransactionForm.State.Field?
@Bindable var store: StoreOf<TransactionForm>

var body: some View {
    TextField("Description", text: $store.transaction.description)
        .focused($focus, equals: .description)
}
.bind($store.focus, to: $focus)
```

**Key Points:**
- Store focus state in reducer for testability
- Use `.bind()` to sync TCA and SwiftUI focus
- Model focus as an enum of focusable fields
- Programmatically control focus in reducer
