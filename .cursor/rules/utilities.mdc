# Common Utilities

## Error Handling

```swift
import IssueReporting

// Usage
withErrorReporting {
    try database.write { db in
        try SyncUp.delete(syncUp).execute(db)
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- From the IssueReporting library (PointFree)
- Centralized error logging with runtime warnings in Xcode
- Swallows errors and returns nil
- Both sync and async variants
- **Use for programmer errors**: Operations that should never fail in production (e.g., deleting with valid IDs, database operations with correct schema)
- **Don't use for user errors**: Operations that can fail due to user input or external factors
- Helps catch bugs during development with clear warnings
